# Project Title

## Overview

This project aims to build a model for [brief description of the competition/task]. We will follow the provided instructions to preprocess the data, train the model, and generate predictions for submission to the competition.

## Instructions

### 1. Get data and set up train/test splits
- Load the data and split it into training and testing sets: X_train, X_test, y_train.

### 2. Preprocess data using Sklearn TFIDF Vectorizer
- Use the Sklearn TFIDF Vectorizer to preprocess the text data.
- Write and save a preprocessor function for later use.

### 3. Fit model on preprocessed data
- Fit a model on the preprocessed data.
- Save the preprocessor function and the trained model for future use.

### 4. Generate predictions from X_test data
- Use the trained model to generate predictions from the X_test data.

### 5. Submit model to competition
- Submit the generated predictions to the competition and record the results.
- Repeat the submission process to improve the placement on the leaderboard.

## Usage

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Sklearn
- [Any other dependencies]
